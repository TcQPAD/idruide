# Grocery List Manager - FullStack

This repository contains the code for both back and front ends of the grocery list manager.
The backend starter I used comes from one of my repository : https://github.com/TcQPAD/starter-express-es6-rest

I developed this starter for the Polytech Nice Conseil, which is an association that intents to get the Junior Entreprise label.
